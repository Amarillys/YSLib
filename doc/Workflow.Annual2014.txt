The MinGW.org and MinGW-W64 runtime can be distinguished by predefined macros, though version macros are not predefined:
	See http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=CAEwic4b-B8%3DQ%3DSV2ptwO36SsCQW%2B6b0N%3DX41t3NHPoDQV%2BKeTw%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=mingw-w64-public .

There may be some wrong impression of border thickness due to the colors.
	It is easy to see the left vertical line of boundary of the checkbox is thicker in setting panel with violet background.
	When the panel background color is some lighter, here is no such illusion.
	Indeed they have the same thickness. It would be obvious after zoomed (esp. > 2x).
	Actually, no rendering code of checkbox has been changed.
